## BMAD Framework

This project uses the BMADâ„¢ (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-driven Development) framework located in `.bmad-core/`:

- **Agent Teams**: `.bmad-core/agent-teams/` - Team configurations for different development phases
- **Individual Agents**: `.bmad-core/agents/` - Specialized AI agents (PM, Dev, Architect, QA, UX Expert)
- **Templates**: `.bmad-core/templates/` - Document templates for PRDs, architecture docs
- **Tasks**: `.bmad-core/tasks/` - Reusable development tasks and workflows
- **Checklists**: `.bmad-core/checklists/` - Quality gates and validation frameworks
- **Data**: `.bmad-core/data/` - Knowledge base and technical preferences

### Using BMAD Agents

When implementing features, follow the BMAD development loop:
1. **Scrum Master Agent** â†’ Creates user stories from technical roadmap
2. **Developer Agent** â†’ Implements approved stories
3. **QA Agent** â†’ Reviews and refactors code  
4. **Architect Agent** â†’ Reviews system design decisions
5. **UX Expert Agent** â†’ Validates user experience and design

### BMAD Workflow Phases
1. **Planning Phase**: Use PM/Architect/UX agents for comprehensive documentation
2. **Development Phase**: SM â†’ Dev â†’ QA cycles for iterative implementation
3. **Integration Phase**: Cross-agent collaboration for system validation

## Database Schema

The database architecture is designed as a multi-tenant SaaS system with the following core entities:

### Primary Tables (PostgreSQL)
- **Users**: Multi-tenant user management with role-based access
- **Tenants**: Gym/studio accounts with subscription tiers and settings
- **Classes**: Class templates with instructor assignment and capacity management
- **Class Schedules**: Time-based class instances with availability tracking
- **Bookings**: User reservations with QR code generation and check-in status
- **Member Credits**: Token-based system with purchase history and expiration
- **Credit Transactions**: Audit trail for all credit movements
- **Notifications**: Multi-channel messaging system (push, email, SMS, WhatsApp)
- **Audit Logs**: Complete activity tracking for compliance

### Caching Layer (Redis)
- Session management and authentication tokens
- Real-time availability updates
- User credit balances
- Popular class recommendations

Detailed schema available in `tech-roadmap-final.md` (lines 79-188) and `mvp-technical-specifications.md` (lines 47-214)

## API Architecture

### RESTful API Endpoints
- **Authentication**: `/api/auth/*` - JWT-based auth with refresh tokens
- **User Management**: `/api/user/*` - Profile, bookings, credits, preferences
- **Studio Discovery**: `/api/studios/*` - Search, filters, details, reviews
- **Class Management**: `/api/classes/*` - Schedules, search, availability
