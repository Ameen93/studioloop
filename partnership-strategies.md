## PARTNERSHIP RISK MITIGATION

### Identified Partnership Risks

#### 1. Over-Dependence on Key Partners
- **Risk:** Single partner failure could damage business
- **Mitigation:** Multiple partners per category, gradual integration
- **Example:** Having both Yoco and Stripe reduces payment risk

#### 2. Partner Conflicts of Interest
- **Risk:** Partners competing with each other or us
- **Mitigation:** Clear exclusivity agreements, defined territories
- **Example:** Gym equipment suppliers get geographic exclusivity

#### 3. Integration Complexity
- **Risk:** Technical integrations taking longer than expected
- **Mitigation:** Phased rollouts, fallback options, experienced dev team
- **Example:** WhatsApp integration starts simple, adds complexity gradually

#### 4. Partnership Cannibalizing Direct Sales
- **Risk:** Partners capturing too much value from referrals
- **Mitigation:** Balanced commission structures, direct customer retention
- **Example:** Equipment bundles don't prevent direct gym sales

### Partnership Exit Strategies

#### Planned Obsolescence
- Build partnerships that can be internalized as we scale
- Maintain option to bring key functions in-house
- Negotiate termination clauses that protect our interests

#### Competitive Protection
- Non-compete clauses where appropriate
